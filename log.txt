module functions:
clientA : client 1 , TCP connection with main server
mainserver: TCP connection with client, UDP connnection with backend-serverA
backend-serverA: UDP connection with mainserver
UDPclient: a UDP client for testing purporse of backend-serverA
what it can:
By far servermain can receive user typed string in commmand line through TCP, then send the string through UDP to backend-serverA,
then backend-serverA is able to print out the string.
next step:
enable backend-server-A to send string back to mainserver through UDP, then mainserver have to send the string back to client through TCP
some issues:
deal with char [] and string conversion
